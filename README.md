# Graetzl

Graetzl is an App to get in touch with your neighbours. Start sharing events, food or other stuff in your neighbourhood. Also let people know if you lost or found something nearby your home! Ask them if they need help with something, like you're injured and need someone who buys groceries for you or you plan on redecorating you home or have some IKEA furniture to assemble.
