# Graetzl

Graetzl is an App to get in touch with your neighbors. Start sharing events, food or other stuff in your neighborhood. Also let people know if you lost or found something nearby your home! Ask them if they need help with something, like if you're temporarily disabled and need someone who buys groceries for you or you plan on redecorating your home or have some IKEA furniture to assemble. Get closer together with your neighbors!
